- 👋 Hi, I’m Johnathan Spiva, also known as @Sprungles on the internet.

- 👀 I’m interested in many things, including code, music, design, and collobareration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, as in my personal opinion, I believe it to be language for future software design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on operating system development, while also working on UX/UI Design.
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter and Mastodon with the handle above!

- Currently I am working on:
  - Replacement Browsers
  - New Operating Systems
  - A New Browser Engine
  - An Android Replacement

- The unfortunate reality is development is slow, so each of these projects are going to take time. So, if you are wishing to give any of these projects a shot, I do take pull requests.
- The big difference is: All of these projects are for the community, and maintained by the community, removing the corporate greed variable.

- If you have any questions on my current projects, pelase reach out!

- And thanks again!
